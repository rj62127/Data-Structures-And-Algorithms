# Daily Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository is dedicated to daily practice of data structures and algorithms. It provides a structured approach to solving algorithmic problems, including daily LeetCode problems, implementation of various data structures, and algorithm solutions.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

### 1. Algorithms

The `Algorithms` folder contains implementations of various algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file and includes a description of the algorithm, its time complexity, and relevant explanations.

### 2. DailyLeet

The `DailyLeet` folder includes solutions to daily LeetCode problems. Each problem is solved in a separate file and includes the problem statement, approach, code solution, and any relevant notes.

### 3. LeetCode

The `LeetCode` folder contains additional solutions to LeetCode problems. Problems are categorized by difficulty and tagged with relevant topics. Each problem solution includes the problem statement, approach, code solution, and explanations.

### 4. Data Structures

The `DataStructures` folder consists of implementations of various data structures. Each data structure is implemented in a separate file and includes a description of the data structure, its operations, and relevant explanations.
